Optimal Grid Reinforcement Planning using DC Power Flow and MILP
Project Overview

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and optimization models for the research paper: "Optimal Grid Reinforcement Planning using DC Power Flow and MILP: A SciGRID Network Case Study."

The project presents a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology for identifying and alleviating congestion in power transmission networks through optimal line reinforcement. The workflow begins with raw, open-source data from the European SciGRID network, proceeds through a large-scale DC Power Flow (DCPF) analysis to identify system-wide bottlenecks, and culminates in a targeted Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimization on a representative network subset to find cost-effective reinforcement strategies.

This work serves as a practical case study and a foundational framework for scalable transmission expansion planning (TEP), demonstrating how to bridge large-scale data analysis with targeted mathematical optimization.
Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several key components:
1. Raw Data (/data/raw/)

This directory should contain the original input data used for the analysis.

    nodes.csv: Node data from the SciGRID dataset, containing substation information.

    edges3.csv: Edge data from the SciGRID dataset, containing transmission line parameters.

2. Analysis and Modeling Scripts (/src/)

This directory contains the source code for the project.

    Power_Flow_Problem.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for all data processing, per-unit system conversion, Largest Connected Component (LCC) extraction, synthetic load/generation allocation, DC Power Flow analysis, and subset creation.

    gams_milp_model.gms: The GAMS code containing the MILP formulation for grid reinforcement, solved using the CPLEX solver. It uses the embedded data from the subset.

3. Generated Data and Results (/output_data/)

This directory contains all the intermediate and final data files generated by the Python and GAMS scripts.

    LCC Analysis Files:

        all_edges_with_pu_values.csv: The original edges data augmented with calculated per-unit values.

        lcc_nodes_complete_data.csv: A complete dataset for the nodes within the LCC, including allocated loads/generation and calculated power injections.

        network_flows_results.csv: Detailed line-by-line flow results from the DCPF analysis on the full LCC.

        thermal_violations_details.csv: A list of the 225 lines identified as overloaded in the initial LCC analysis.

        active_network_lcc.graphml: A GraphML file representing the LCC graph object, which can be loaded in NetworkX or visualized in tools like Gephi.

    GAMS Input Files:

        gams_input_nodes.csv: Processed node data (ID and P_injection_pu) for the full LCC, used as a basis for subsetting.

        gams_input_edges.csv: Processed edge data (u, v, x_pu, P_th_max_pu, cost_c) for the full LCC.

        gams_subset_data_block_*.txt: Text files containing the formatted data for the 30-node subset, ready to be included or pasted into a GAMS model.

    Optimization Results:

        pyomo_milp_results.csv: CSV output from the Pyomo/Gurobi run, detailing the solution for comparison. (Note: The final paper focuses on the GAMS/CPLEX results).

4. Figures (/figures/)

This directory contains key visualizations.

    active_network_lcc.png: The plot of the full LCC showing initial overloads (Figure 1 in the paper).

    Directed_Scigrid_Network.png: An optional, earlier visualization of the directed graph.

    optimization_results_comparison_chart.png: The bar chart comparing initial capacity, new capacity, and post-reinforcement flow for selected lines from the MILP solution.

Methodology Workflow

The project follows a multi-stage workflow:

    Data Processing (Python): nodes.csv and edges3.csv are processed. A per-unit system (100 MVA base) is established to normalize electrical parameters.

    LCC Extraction and Analysis (Python): The Largest Connected Component (LCC) of the grid is identified (469 nodes, 627 lines). A 10,000 MW synthetic load/generation scenario is applied, and a DC Power Flow analysis identifies 225 overloaded lines.

    Subset Creation (Python): A 30-node, 37-line connected subset is programmatically extracted from the LCC using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to create a tractable problem for optimization. Reinforcement costs are generated based on line length.

    MILP Optimization (GAMS/CPLEX): An MILP model is solved for the subset to minimize total post-reinforcement line overload, subject to a budget constraint. The model identifies an optimal set of 13 lines to reinforce.

How to Use This Repository

    Review the Code: The Power_Flow_Problem.ipynb notebook provides a step-by-step guide through the data analysis and preprocessing pipeline. The gams_milp_model.gms file contains the final optimization model used for the subset.

    Explore the Data: The files in the /output_data/ directory provide a rich dataset for further analysis, including the results of the initial power flow and the final optimization.

    Reproduce the Study: By running the Jupyter Notebook, users can reproduce the data processing steps. The GAMS model can be run with the provided embedded data to replicate the optimization results.
