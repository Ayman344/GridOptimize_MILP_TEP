‚ÄúOptimal Grid Reinforcement Planning using DC Power Flow and MILP: A SciGRID Network Case Study‚Äù

This project presents a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology for identifying and mitigating congestion in power transmission networks through optimal line reinforcement. It demonstrates how large-scale data analysis can be effectively combined with targeted mathematical optimization for transmission expansion planning (TEP).

üìä Overview
Starting with open-source European SciGRID network data, the workflow proceeds as follows:

Perform DC Power Flow (DCPF) analysis on the full network to identify overloaded lines.

Extract a representative 30-node subset of the largest connected component (LCC) using a breadth-first search algorithm.

Solve a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to determine cost-effective reinforcement strategies for the subset under a budget constraint.

This project serves as both a practical case study and a reusable framework for scalable grid reinforcement planning.

üîç Methodology Workflow
Data Processing:
Convert SciGRID data to per-unit system (100 MVA base), prepare network parameters.

LCC Analysis:
Identify the 469-node LCC, apply a 10,000 MW synthetic scenario, perform DCPF, detect 225 overloaded lines.

Subset Creation:
Extract a 30-node, 37-line connected subset, compute reinforcement costs.

Optimization:
Solve MILP on the subset to minimize overload while respecting budget constraints, resulting in optimal reinforcement of 13 lines.
